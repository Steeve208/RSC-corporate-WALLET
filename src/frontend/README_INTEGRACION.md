# 🚀 Quick Integration Guide - RSC Web

## Fastest Way (Recommended)

### Step 1: Copy the folder
Copy the entire `frontend/` folder to your RSC web project.

### Step 2: Install dependencies
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Step 3: Run in development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Build for production
```bash
npm run build
```

The compiled files will be in `frontend/dist/` - serve these from your web server.
